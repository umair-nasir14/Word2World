      "In the sprawling, neon-bathed city of Veridia, Mira was known not just for her technical savvy, but for her intense determination to resurrect the abandoned northern sector. Once a thriving community hub, it had deteriorated into a wasteland of crumbling buildings and flickering street lights, now more commonly referred to as the Ghost Quarter. Her mission was clear: restore the Ghost Quarter to its former vibrancy and secure a safe, thriving environment for its potential residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her antagonist, however, was the formidable tycoon known as Graydon Creed, a man who had grown immensely wealthy by monopolizing the city's resources. Creed had his eyes set on converting the Ghost Quarter into a luxury resort, catering exclusively to the elite. Creed’s vision was a stark contrast to Mira’s dream of an inclusive community, and he was prepared to use all his power to thwart her plans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mira’s strategy was composed of eight crucial objectives: secure funding, gain community support, renovate the infrastructure, implement sustainable energy solutions, create affordable housing, establish local businesses, advocate for public green spaces, and, most challengingly, remove Creed’s influence from the quarter. Each goal was a step towards not just revitalizing the area, but also fortifying it against Creed’s corporate onslaught.\n",
      "\n",
      "She started by holding community meetings in the dimly lit halls of the old community center, where flickers of enthusiasm began to replace the shadows of doubt. Gradually, Mira garnered significant local support, their collective voice growing strong. Meanwhile, she worked tirelessly to pitch her vision to various investors, emphasizing the long-term social and economic benefits. Her proposals for green technology and self-sustaining buildings began to attract forward-thinking investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turning point came when Mira discovered Creed had been involved in several underhanded dealings to sabotage her project. Armed with this information, she launched a campaign exposing Creed’s tactics, rallying both public support and legal scrutiny against him. This challenge culminated in a heated debate, broadcasted citywide, where Mira’s fervor and Creed’s deceit stood in stark contrast, tipping public opinion firmly in her favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, Mira’s persistence paid off. Creed's influence waned under legal pressures and public disapproval, allowing her to push forward with her objectives. The Ghost Quarter slowly transformed, blooming with new life and hope as Mira’s vision came to fruition, proving that sometimes, the strength of a community’s spirit can outshine the power of any single adversary.\n",

      "**Mira (Protagonist)**\n",
      "- **Appearance**: Mira is a dynamic, young engineer with a futuristic sense of style. She has medium-length, electric blue hair, which she wears in a practical ponytail. Mira’s attire is a blend of utilitarian and cyberpunk aesthetics; she wears a fitted, armored vest tailored with LED accents and techno-patterns, complemented by cargo pants and high-tech, cushioned boots suitable for urban exploration. She is equipped with a utility belt holding various gadgets and tools.\n",
      "- **Animation Suggestion**: Mira should have animations for running, jumping, using gadgets, and interacting with environment elements (like computers and machinery). An animation for rallying the community (perhaps raising a fist or giving a spirited speech) would also accentuate her character.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Graydon Creed (Antagonist)**\n",
      "- **Appearance**: Creed is an imposing figure in his late fifties, wrapped in the trappings of wealth and power. He sports a slicked-back hairstyle, graying at the temples, and a neat, dark beard that outlines his strong jawline. His usual attire consists of a luxurious dark suit with subtle digital enhancements that shimmer slightly under light—a symbol of his wealth and connection to high tech. His cold, calculating eyes are emphasized, giving him a menacing look.\n",
      "- **Animation Suggestion**: Creed should have animations that reflect his authoritative and manipulative nature, such as pointing menacingly, laughing derisively, or slamming his fist in anger. A walking animation that exudes confidence and power would also be fitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Environment Art for the Ghost Quarter**\n",
      "- **Appearance**: The Ghost Quarter is a blend of decaying old structures and the bones of failed futuristic projects. The landscape is dotted with dilapidated buildings, overgrown with vegetation, and streets littered with debris. Neon signs flicker sporadically, casting an eerie glow. As the game progresses, this environment should gradually transform, showing signs of renovation and revitalization—new buildings, clean streets, and functional, modern streetlights and neon.\n",
      "- **Animation Suggestion**: Environmental animations should include flickering neon signs, occasional sparks from broken electrical lines, and interactive elements like debris that can be cleared or renovated structures that visually upgrade as progress is made in the game.\n",

You extract meaning from a given story. You are also provided by Python dictionary-like mapping of tiles and characters or alphabets. You evaluate based on how the tiles have been placed and if they match how the story has explained. For example characters should be placed once.

If the world looks aesthetically nice then you give good evaluation, otherwise bad. If the character tiles are not placed then it is bad. All tiles should be placed nicely.
